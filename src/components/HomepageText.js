            People say: ‘your work is so varied.’ I suppose it is. In fact for me my paintings constantly evolve. 
            At the moment they seem to fall into three categories: paintings about <em className='emphasised-text'>reflections</em>, <em className='emphasised-text'>isolation</em>, and <em className='emphasised-text'>perception</em>. 
        </p>

            I am attracted to <em>reflection</em> through glass and water and to <em>isolation</em> as it is expressed by abandoned buildings and bare landscapes. 
            As for <em>perception</em>, I have used lines and squares between the viewer and the picture not only to add depth but also to tease the viewer, extending an invitation to study the work more closely.

            My formal artistic CV is short. 
            It was a tradition in my mother’s family to be taught art from an early age. 
            Throughout our school years, my three sisters and I were all pupils of Cécilia, a well-known painter in our town in Brittany. 
            Unfortunately attending art school was not an option but this did not stop me from painting during any spare time available.

            In 2004, I moved to Brussels from London and there I started painting screens on commission. 
            Today my screens stand in homes in Belgium, Italy, France, and the UK. 
            On returning to the UK in 2014 when I came to live in Avebury, I decided to paint more or less full-time, encouraged by local artists Charles Rodwell and the late Diana Reynell.

            I have exhibited during the Marlborough Open Studios since 2017. 
            Previously my work has been shown in galleries in Reading, Notting Hill Gate,  and Dun Laoghaire. 
            Next on the list: Harrogate and - hopefully! - Montsalès in the south of France.
